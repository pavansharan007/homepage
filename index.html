  <h3 class="faq-title">1. What is a Demat Account?</h3>
  <div class="faq-content">
            A Demat (short for Dematerialised) is an electronic account used to hold and manage investments like Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds in a digital format.
            Just as you need to have a bank account to deposit your money and earn interest, you need to open a Demat account to buy or sell financial securities such as Stocks, Mutual Funds, Equity Traded Funds (ETFs), SGBs and more.
            When you buy stocks or shares, they will get credited to your account. When you sell the stocks or shares you have purchased, they will get debited from your account.
            By opening a Demat account, you do not need to transfer your share certificates physically to the buyer. You need to link your bank account with your Demat account, through which you can easily buy and sell shares. It does not only save your time, but it also reduces the transaction cost.

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-green-800 mb-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq"><div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">1. What is the stock market?<span>+</span></div>
  <div class="answer">The stock market is a marketplace where investors can buy and sell shares of publicly listed companies. It acts as a platform that facilitates the exchange of ownership in businesses, allowing individuals and institutions to invest in companies and participate in their financial growth. When you buy a stock, you become a part-owner or shareholder of that company and are entitled to a portion of its profits, usually in the form of dividends or capital gains if the stock price rises.

    The stock market plays a crucial role in the economy by helping businesses raise capital to grow and expand through the issuance of shares via initial public offerings (IPOs). It also offers investors an opportunity to grow their wealth over time. Prices in the stock market are influenced by various factors such as company performance, economic indicators, global events, and investor sentiment. While investing in the stock market can be rewarding, it also involves risks, which is why it's important for investors to research, diversify their investments, and make informed decisions.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq"><div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">2. Why invest in the stock market?<span>+</span></div>
  <div class="answer">Investing in the stock market is one of the best ways to grow your money over time. When you invest in stocks, you‚Äôre buying small parts of companies. If those companies grow and make more profits, the value of your shares increases, and you can earn money by selling them at a higher price. Some companies also pay dividends ‚Äî a part of their profit ‚Äî to shareholders, which gives you extra income just for holding the stock.

    The stock market helps you beat inflation, which means your money doesn‚Äôt lose its value over time. Unlike keeping cash in a savings account, where interest is low, the stock market can give higher returns in the long run. It also gives you a chance to build wealth and reach your financial goals, such as buying a house, funding education, or saving for retirement.
    
    Another benefit is that it allows you to invest in companies you believe in ‚Äî from tech giants to local businesses ‚Äî and be part of their success. While there are risks involved because prices can go up and down, learning how to invest wisely and staying patient can lead to great rewards. In simple words, the stock market is a powerful tool to grow your money and secure your future.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq"><div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">3. Stock vs Shares<span>+</span></div>
  <div class="answer">
  <table>
  <tr><th>Stock</th><th>Share</th></tr>
  <tr><td>General ownership in one or more companies.</td><td>Specific unit of ownership in a company.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Broad term used commonly.</td><td>Precise and quantifiable.</td></tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq"><div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">4. How does the stock market work?<span>+</span></div>
  <div class="answer">The stock market works as a platform where buyers and sellers come together to trade shares of publicly listed companies. When a company wants to raise money, it can sell parts of its ownership in the form of shares through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Once these shares are available on the stock market, anyone can buy or sell them. This buying and selling happens through stock exchanges like the NSE (National Stock Exchange) or BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) in India.

    The prices of stocks change constantly based on supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock, the price goes up. If more people want to sell, the price goes down. These price changes are also influenced by news, company performance, economic conditions, interest rates, and global events.
    
    Investors usually use brokers or online trading platforms to place orders to buy or sell. Once an order is matched on the exchange, the transaction is completed, and the buyer gets ownership of the shares, which are stored in their demat (dematerialized) account. This entire process is managed electronically and takes just a few seconds.</div></div>
    
  <div class="faq"><div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">5. Tips for Beginners<span>+</span></div>
  <div class="answer">‚Ä¢ Start Small:
    Begin with a small amount of money you're comfortable risking. Learn gradually before making big investments.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Understand the Basics:
    Learn basic terms like shares, IPO, P/E ratio, mutual funds, SIP, dividends, and market capitalization.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Do Your Research:
    Always research a company before investing. Look into its financials, past performance, industry trends, and news.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Think Long-Term:
    Don't aim for quick profits. Long-term investments usually offer better returns and lower risks.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Diversify Your Portfolio:
    Don‚Äôt put all your money into one stock. Invest in different sectors to reduce risk.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Avoid Herd Mentality:
    Don‚Äôt follow what everyone else is doing blindly. Make decisions based on your own analysis and goals.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Use a Demat and Trading Account Wisely:
    Open a demat and trading account with a reliable broker and learn how to use it properly.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt Panic During Market Fluctuations:
    Prices go up and down often. Stay calm and avoid panic selling.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Set Goals and a Budget:
    Know why you're investing (e.g., saving for the future, buying a house) and invest accordingly.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Keep Learning:
    The market keeps evolving. Read books, follow financial news, and watch educational videos to improve your knowledge.</div></div>
  <div class="faq"><div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">6. Common Mistakes to Avoid<span>+</span></div>
  <div class="answer">
    ‚Ä¢ Investing Without Research:
     Never buy a stock just because someone else recommended it. Always research the company before investing.
    
     ‚Ä¢  Following the Crowd (Herd Mentality):
    Blindly following others can lead to losses. Make decisions based on facts, not hype.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Expecting Quick Profits:
    The stock market is not a ‚Äúget-rich-quick‚Äù scheme. Long-term patience usually leads to better rewards.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Putting All Money in One Stock:
    Lack of diversification increases risk. Spread your investment across multiple sectors and companies.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Panic Selling During Market Falls:
    Market ups and downs are normal. Don‚Äôt sell in fear when prices drop; stay focused on your goals.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Ignoring Company Fundamentals:
    Buying stocks without checking a company‚Äôs financial health, management, and growth prospects is risky.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Overtrading:
    Frequently buying and selling stocks can lead to high brokerage charges and poor returns.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Investing Borrowed Money:
    Never invest money that you can‚Äôt afford to lose, especially borrowed money or emergency funds.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Timing the Market:
    Trying to predict exact highs and lows is very difficult. Focus on time in the market, not timing the market.
    
    ‚Ä¢  Neglecting to Review Portfolio:
    Regularly check and update your portfolio as market conditions and your goals change.</div></div>
